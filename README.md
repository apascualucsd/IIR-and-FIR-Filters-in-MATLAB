# IIR-and-FIR-Filters-in-MATLAB
Remez, Windowed Sinc, Cheby2, and Tony_des2 filters 

Remez: 
Sample rate 88.2 kHz.
passband 0 to 20 kHz.	Passband Ripple	0.1 dB
Stopband 24 to 44.1 kHz.	Stopband attenuation -90 dB
Estimate the required filter length. 
Design filter and present impulse response, Log magnitude frequency response, and Zoom to passband ripple frequency response.

Kaiser windowed sinc: 
Sample rate 88.2 kHz.
passband 0 to 20 kHz.	Passband Ripple	0.1 dB
Stopband 24 to 44.1 kHz.	Stopband attenuation -90 dB

Estimate the required filter length. 
Design filter and present impulse response, Log magnitude frequency response, and Zoom 
to passband ripple frequency response.

Cheby2: 
Sample rate 88.2 kHz.
passband 0 to 20 kHz.	Passband Ripple	0.1 dB
Stopband 24 to 44.1 kHz.	Stopband attenuation -90 dB
What order IIR filter was required to meet the filter specifications. 

Design filter and use the Matlab TF2SOS to convert the numerator and denominator of the IIR design to second order sub-filters. Use the second order filters to determine the required scaling factor for each sub-filter. Use the cascade filters to determine the impulse response. Present the impulse response, Log magnitude frequency response, and Zoom to passband ripple frequency response.

Tony_des2:
Sample rate 88.2 kHz.
passband 0 to 20 kHz.	Passband Ripple	0.1 dB
Stopband 24 to 44.1 kHz.	Stopband attenuation -90 dB
What order ALL-PASS filter was required to meet the filter specifications? 
Design filter and use the sum of the two-path impulse response to form the impulse response. Present the impulse response, Log magnitude frequency response, and Zoom to passband ripple frequency response.
